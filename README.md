Welcome to my Cybersecurity Threat Analysis & Network Security repository!
This project reflects my hands-on learning experience in analyzing real-world threats, understanding network vulnerabilities, and practicing SOC-relevant skills to become proficient in cybersecurity operations.

Purpose
The aim of this journey is to strengthen and showcase my skills in identifying, analyzing, and responding to security threatsâ€”especially focusing on email-based attacks, port scanning, and network monitoring.
This repo documents my understanding of key concepts and practical tools used by SOC analysts and blue teams to defend infrastructure from cyber threats.
